GPT-3.5 Turbo-0301: This is an updated version of GPT-3.5 Turbo that was released in March 2021. It has the same number of parameters as the base version, but it has a larger context window of 1280 tokens. It also has some improvements to its language understanding and generation capabilities.
GPT-3.5 Turbo-0618: This is another updated version of GPT-3.5 Turbo that was released in June 2021. It has the same context window as the 0301 version, but it has 180 billion parameters. This makes it slightly larger and more powerful than the previous versions.
GPT-3.5 Turbo-16k: This is a version of GPT-3.5 Turbo that has a 16,000 token context window. This is twice as large as the context window of the other versions, which gives it the ability to understand and generate more complex and nuanced text.
GPT-3.5 Turbo-16k-0618: This is the latest version of GPT-3.5 Turbo. It has the same 16,000 token context window as the 16k version, but it has 180 billion parameters. This makes it the most powerful version of GPT-3.5 Turbo to date.

what is token context token:
The context window is a critical concept in NLP, as it allows models to learn the meaning of words and phrases in context. This is important for tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and question answering.

In the case of GPT-3.5 Turbo-16k, the 16,000 token context window means that the model can consider up to 16,000 tokens before and after the target token when making predictions. This gives the model a much richer understanding of the context in which the target token is being used, which can lead to more accurate predictions.
